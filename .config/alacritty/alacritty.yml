  # Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files,

  # If a field is already present in a previous import,
  # it will be replaced.
  #
  # All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`,
  # or paths relative to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.

  # Some entries may override variables set by alacritty itself.
  #
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
